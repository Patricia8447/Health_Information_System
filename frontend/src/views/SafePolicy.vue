      as the “Sites”) are powered by Time Creation Limited (the “Company”, “FindDoc”, “We”
      or “Us”). FindDoc is committed to respecting the privacy rights of our customers,
      visitors, and other Users of the FindDoc services (“Services”) provided via the
      Sites. We created this website privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to give you
      confidence as you visit and use the Sites, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair
      information practices and the protection of privacy. This Privacy Policy is only
      applicable to the Sites, and not to any other websites that you may be able to
      access from the Sites or any website of FindDoc’s partners, each of which may have
      data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from
      this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Sites is governed by this Privacy Policy and
      the Terms of Use.
    </p>

      <h4>5. Cookies</h4> “Cookies” are small computer files that are transferred to your
      computer's hard drive that contain information such as user ID, user preferences,
      lists of pages visited and activities conducted while browsing the Website. At your
      option, expense and responsibility, you may block cookies or delete cookies from
      your hard drive. However, by disabling cookies, you may not have access to the
      entire set of features of the Sites. Generally, we use “cookies” to customize your

      each time you visit the Sites. In addition, our business partners may use cookies to
      provide us with anonymous data and information regarding the use of our Sites.
      Specifically, some of our business partners use cookies to show FindDoc ads on other
      sites on the internet as a result of you using the Website. Such cookies do not
      contain any Personal Information. Other cookies used by our business partners may
      collect other non-personally identifying information, such as the computer’s IP
      address, type of operating system, type of browser, what web pages were viewed at
      what time, the geographic location of your internet service provider and demographic
      information, such as gender and age range. This information is used to provide
      FindDoc with more information about our users’ demographics and internet behaviors.

      receiving these cookies by visiting the follwing link:
      https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. We do not link the information stored in

      <h4>6. Web Beacons</h4> In limited circumstances we also may use “Web Beacons” to collect
      anonymous, non-personal information about your use of our Sites and the sites of
      selected sponsors and advertisers, and your use of emails, special promotions or
      newsletters we send to you. “Web Beacons” are tiny graphic image files imbedded in a
      web page or email that provide a presence on the web page or email and send back to
      its home server information from the user’s browser. The information collected by
      web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using the Sites
      and selected sponsors' and advertisers' sites, or opening our emails, and for what
      purposes.
    </p>
    <br /> <br /> 
    <p>
      <h4>7. Website Analytics</h4> We may use third party website analytics services in connection
      with the Sites. These services do not track your browsing habits across websites
      which do not use their services. We are using the information collected from these
      services to find usability problems to make the Sites easier to use. The collected
      data will never identify you or your account. We only record anonymous user
      information.
    </p>
    <br /> <br /> 
    <p>
      <h4>8. Storage</h4> We store all Traffic Data and review postings indefinitely, even after
      “deletion,” and may archive such information elsewhere. We store all Personal
      Information until you request that we modify or delete it, in which case we may
      still wind up retaining some of that information for the reasons described in
      Section 18 below.
    </p>
    <br /> <br /> 
    <p>
      <h4>9. FindDoc’s Use of Your Information</h4> We may use your Contact Data to send you
      information about FindDoc or our products or Services, to contact you when
      necessary, including to remind you of upcoming or follow-up appointments, and in
      conjunction with your use of certain Interactive Tools. We may use your Demographic
      Data, your Traffic Data, your Insurance Data or your Medical Data to customize and
      tailor your experience on the Sites, in emails and in other communications,
      displaying content that we think you might be interested in and according to your
      preferences. You agree that FindDoc may use Personal Information to allow your
      doctors to make appointments with other doctors on your behalf through the Services.
    </p>
    <br /> <br /> 
    <p>
      <h4>10. Sharing of Information</h4> We share certain categories of information we collect
      from you in the ways described in this Privacy Policy. We may share Demographic Data
      with advertisers and other third parties only on an aggregate (i.e.,
      non-personally-identifiable) basis. We may also share your Contact Data, Demographic
      Data, Insurance Data and Medical Data with Providers you choose to schedule on our
      Website. We also share Personal Information and Traffic Data with our business
      partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing,
      fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to our operation of the Website
      and/or by making certain Interactive Tools available to our users. Those business
      partners shall be bound to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality
      that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your
      Contact Data and other Personal Information to carry out their specific business
      obligations to FindDoc and to provide your requested medical care and services.
      Last, we may transfer information about you to another company in connection with a
      merger, sale or acquisition by or of FindDoc. In this event, we will use reasonable
      efforts to notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes
      subject to a different privacy policy. FindDoc does not share, sell, rent or trade
      your Personal Information with any third parties for their promotional purposes.
    </p>
    <br /> <br /> 
    <p>
      <h4>11. User Choice</h4> You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. In
      such an event, you can still access and use much of the Sites; however you will not
      be able to access and use those portions of the Sites that require your Personal
      Information.
    </p>
    <br /> <br /> 
    <p>
      <h4>12. Confidentiality and Security</h4> Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy
      Policy, we will keep your Personal Information private and will not share it with
      third parties, unless we believe in good faith that disclosure of your Personal
      Information or any other information we collect about you is necessary to: (1)
      comply with a court order or other legal process; (2) protect the rights, property
      or safety of FindDoc or another party; (3) enforce our Terms of Use; or (4) respond
      to claims that any posting or other content violates the rights of third-parties.
    </p>
    <br /> <br /> 
    <p>
      <h4>13. Doctors</h4> Doctors, dentists, their employees, and their agents should
      be particularly aware of their obligations of patient confidentiality, including
      without limitation their obligations under the codes issued by the Medical Council
      of Hong Kong, both in communicating with FindDoc and in responding to a review of
      their services posted on our Sites. FindDoc does not have, and will not accept, any
      obligations of confidentiality with respect to any communications other than those
      expressly stated in this Privacy Policy and FindDoc’s Terms of Use.
    </p>
    <br /> <br /> 
    <p>
      <h4>14. Public Information</h4> Any information that you may reveal in a review posting or
      other online discussion or forum is intentionally open to the public and is not in
      any way private. You should think carefully before disclosing any personally
      identifiable information in any public forum. What you have written may be seen
      and/or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to
      control or predict.
    </p>
    <br /> <br /> 
    <p>
      <h4>15. Security</h4> The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We follow
      generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted
      to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, when you enter
      sensitive information on our Sites, we encrypt that information using secure socket
      layer technology (SSL). Although we make good faith efforts to store Personal
      Information in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public, you
      should understand that there is no such thing as complete security, and we do not
      guarantee that there will be no unintended disclosures of your Personal Information.
      If we become aware that your Personal Information has been disclosed in a manner not
      in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you
      of the nature and extent of the disclosure (to the extent we know that information)
      as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law.
    </p>
    <br /> <br /> 
    <p>
      <h4>16. Lost or Stolen Information</h4> You must promptly notify us if your Contact Data is
      lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will remove that
      Contact Data from your account and update our records accordingly.
    </p>
    <br /> <br /> 
    <p>
      <h4>17. Updates and Changes to Privacy</h4> Policy We reserve the right, at any time, to add
      to, change, update, or modify this Privacy Policy so please review it frequently. If
      we do, then we will notify you here, as well as by posting a notice on our Website
      and/or by e-mailing you, along with a description of any changes (material or
      otherwise) and, where appropriate, a link to the modified policy so that you can
      review it. In all cases, use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy
      Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.
    </p>
    <br /> <br /> 
    <p>
      <h4>18. Controlling Your Personal Information</h4> As a registered user of the Sites, you can
      modify some of the Personal Information you have included in your profile or change
      your username by logging in and accessing your account. Upon your request, FindDoc
      will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete your account and the Personal
      Information in your profile; however, it may be impossible to remove your account
      without some residual information being retained by FindDoc. Registered users who
      wish to close their account should contact info@finddoc.com.
    </p>

      decide to visit one of these third party websites, we suggest that you read its
      privacy policy.
